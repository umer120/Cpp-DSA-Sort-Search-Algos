# Cpp-DSA-Sort-Search-Algos
This repository contains some algorithms in Cpp language

# selection-sort.cpp

Contains the implementation of Selection sort algorithm in C++

# linear-binary-search.cpp

File is a solution of the following question:

Create a C++ class named Student, with the following PRIVATE attributes:

1.	regNo: int (consider that registration number is a max 4-digit number)
   
3.	CGPA: float


Your task is to implement 10 objects of students. Initialize all objects (you can use the rand() function to make things easier) and perform the following Search algorithms on them based on CGPA.
a)	Linear Search
b)	Binary Search
These functions MUST be implemented as PUBLIC member functions of the class Student.
